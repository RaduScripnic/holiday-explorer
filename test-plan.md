## üí° Principles of Testing

For the Holiday Explorer project, a combination of manual testing and an understanding of automated testing principles were applied to ensure a robust and user-friendly experience.

* **Manual Testing:** This was the primary testing method employed. It involves human testers interacting directly with the web application to simulate real user behavior. Manual testing was crucial for:
    * **Usability:** Evaluating how intuitive and easy the interface is to use, including navigation and feedback mechanisms.
    * **Visual Fidelity & Responsiveness:** Checking if the design renders correctly and adapts well across different screen sizes and devices.
    * **End-to-End Functionality:** Verifying complex user flows, such as searching for a city, seeing markers appear, and interacting with info windows.
    * **Accessibility:** Ensuring keyboard navigation, proper ARIA attributes, and sufficient color contrast are functional for users with disabilities.
    Manual testing was deployed continuously throughout the development process, allowing for immediate feedback and iterative improvements.

* **Automated Testing (Conceptual Application):** While not fully implemented with code for this project's scope, automated testing would typically involve writing scripts to run tests automatically. This would be deployed for:
    * **Unit Tests:** To verify individual JavaScript functions (e.g., `initMap`, `createMarker`, `clearMarkers`, input validation logic) work as expected in isolation.
    * **Integration Tests:** To ensure different parts of the application (e.g., the search button interacting with the Geocoding API and then the Places API) function correctly when combined.
    * **Regression Tests:** To quickly confirm that new code changes do not break existing functionality.
    Automated tests are best suited for repeatable, precise checks and would significantly speed up the testing process in a larger, continuously developed application.

## ‚úÖ Usability Testing

| Area                        | Scenario                                             | Result | Observation/Fixes                                         |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Navigation clarity         | User understands how to search                      | ‚úÖ     | The prominent search bar and button make the primary action clear. |
| Button accessibility       | Tab and Enter keys work on search button            | ‚úÖ     | Confirmed focus states and activation via keyboard.       |
| Error feedback             | Clear message for empty/invalid search              | ‚úÖ     | Error messages are red and appear directly below the input. |
| Map interaction            | Zoom, pan and click are intuitive                   | ‚úÖ     | Standard Google Maps controls provide expected interaction. |
