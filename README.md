# README.md - Holiday Explorer

## üåç Project Overview

Holiday Explorer helps users find ideal travel destinations using the **Google Maps and Places APIs**. With an intuitive interface, users can search by city and view accommodations, restaurants, and attractions to help plan their perfect getaway.

- **External User Goal:** Find the best holiday destination tailored to their interests.
- **Site Owner Goal:** Guide users to book via the platform and increase conversions through sponsor partnerships.

**Rationale for Development:**
The core purpose of Holiday Explorer is to provide a seamless and interactive way for users to discover potential holiday destinations. By integrating powerful Google Maps and Places APIs, the application aims to reduce the friction in early-stage travel planning, offering immediate visual context and points of interest. The design prioritizes user-friendliness and accessibility to cater to a broad audience of travelers. The long-term goal is to establish the platform as a go-to resource, eventually incorporating features for booking and partnering with travel agencies to monetize the service. This aligns with the site owner's goal of increasing conversions and sponsor partnerships.

**User Stories:**
* As a traveler, I want to be able to search for a city by name so that I can see it on a map and identify potential holiday spots.
* As a traveler, I want to see relevant points of interest like attractions, restaurants, and hotels marked on the map so I can easily plan my itinerary.
* As a traveler, I want clear feedback if my search input is invalid or if no results are found so I don't get stuck.
* As a traveler, I want the website to be easy to use on my mobile phone so I can plan on the go.
